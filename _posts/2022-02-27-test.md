# 3-Body Simulation

This is how I went about writing the code to simulate 3 planets based on Newtons laws of motion.
The resulting code was the basis of a eurorack hardware module which outputs the position of each planet as an X and Y voltage.


## Newton's Equations of Motion

The 2 equations that we will need are, Newton's second law:

$$F = ma$$

and, Newton's equation of universal gravitation:

This is just a test:

$$\int e^{-kx} \, dx = -\frac{1}{k} e^{-kx}$$
